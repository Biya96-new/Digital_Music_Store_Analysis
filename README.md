This project demonstrates how SQL was used to examine the dataset of a Music Store to gain insights into business growth and customer behaviors. By answering a series of key business questions, the store was able to better understand its customer base, popular products, and revenue streams. The analysis provides valuable information to help the store make data-driven decisions, such as identifying the best customers, the top-performing cities, and the most popular music genres.

**The analysis primarily involved the following tables:**

Employees: Contains data about employees, including job titles and hire dates.
Invoices: Contains data about sales invoices, including the total amount, customer ID, and billing information.
Customers: Contains customer details such as first name, last name, email, country, and customer ID.
Tracks: Contains details of each music track, including track names, genre, artist, and track length.
Artists: Contains data about artists, including artist names.
InvoiceItems: Contains details of each item in an invoice, such as track ID and unit price.
